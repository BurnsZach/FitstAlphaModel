# FitstAlphaModel
Group Project attempting to combine fundamental, technical, and sentiment analysis to create factors for an Alpha Model

CSCO, KTOS, GME, NCHL wer chosen at random

We gathered stock info from Yahoo Finance, techical info using the TTR package in R, and Sentiment metrics were obtained from Reddit's subreddit "WallStreetBets"

This project was the first time we have been exposed to an Alpha Model and it gave us an opportunity to get hands on with data.
